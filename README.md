## 📌 Overview

This repository documents a **containerized ToDo List application** built using a modern **microservices architecture**, composed of:

- 🧠 A **Python backend** (Flask or FastAPI) for task logic and APIs  
- 🎨 A **React frontend** for user interactions  
- 🗃️ A **PostgreSQL** database for persistent task storage  
- 🐳 **Docker Compose** to orchestrate all components as independent services

> ⚠️ The **source code is not available** in this repository.  
> 📝 You’ll find a **project presentation PDF** explaining the design, architecture, and features.

## 🧱 Architecture

This project follows a clean microservice design:

- 📦 **Frontend** communicates with backend through HTTP (REST API)
- ⚙️ **Backend** handles business logic and database queries
- 🗂️ **Database** persists the tasks
- 🔄 All components are isolated and managed with Docker
